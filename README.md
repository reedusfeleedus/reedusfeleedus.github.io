# Portfolio Terminal: Where Code Meets Creativity 🚀

Welcome to my digital command center - a portfolio that breaks the mold of traditional resumes. This isn't just another website; it's an interactive experience that lets you explore my professional journey through the lens of a Unix-style terminal.

## Why Terminal Style?
Because great developers appreciate elegance in simplicity. Navigate through my experience using familiar commands like `ls` and `cat`, or switch to AI mode for an intelligent conversation in natural language about my projects and skills. It's your choice: go full terminal purist or chat naturally with an AI assistant powered by GPT-4.
