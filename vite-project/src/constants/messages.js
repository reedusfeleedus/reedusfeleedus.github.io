üëã Welcome! 
This is a fake terminal - I thought it would be a fun way to explore my portfolio.
‚ö†Ô∏è  Since this is a terminal interface, it's designed for desktop viewing. Mobile experience will be limited.

I would suggest checking out the site tutorial on the top to get started, or type 'help' to see available commands.
This site comes with two modes:

1. AI ASSISTANT (For non-technical users): Type 'ai' to enter AI mode, type 'exit' to exit AI mode.
2. TERMINAL COMMANDS (For tech-savvy users): Use normal terminal commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'pwd', etc.

Happy exploring! üöÄ`,
