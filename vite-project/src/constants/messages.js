Welcome! This is a fake terminal. I thought it would be a fun way to explore my portfolio. 
There are two ways to do this:

AI ASSISTANT (Recommended for non-technical users): 
- Type 'ai' to enter AI mode
- Type 'exit' to exit AI mode
- Simply ask questions in natural language if you have any questions about my experience, skills, or projects
- Example: "What projects have you worked on?" or "Tell me about your backend experience"

TERMINAL COMMANDS (More fun if you're tech-savvy):
- Type 'help' to see all available commands
- Use 'ls' to view portfolio sections
- Read files with 'cat' (e.g. 'cat projects.txt')
- Tab completion and command history supported

Type 'clear' for a fresh start. Happy exploring! ðŸš€`,
